I am a Minerva fellow at the University of Oldenburg in cooperation with Ben-Gurion University.
Until January 2025 I was a postdoc in the group of Steffen Müller at the University of Groningen, Netherlands.
From February to July 2025 I was a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn. 

### Research interests

I am interested in arithmetic geometry, specifically the use of
fundamental groups to study rational and integral points of schemes.
The Chabauty–Kim method, while rooted in deep considerations about the motivic fundamental group
and still being largely conjectural, has proved very successful in explicitly solving polynomial
equations in recent years. I am exploring both the theoretical and practical aspects of the method,
in particular in the setting of S-integral points on affine hyperbolic curves. What I find exciting
about this line of research is that deep ideas from geometry can be used to solve very concrete
problems from number theory.

I am moreover interested in Grothendieck's conjectures
on anabelian geometry which he formulated in his letter to Faltings. There, the Section Conjecture
predicts a description of rational points purely in terms of étale fundamental groups.
Recently, with A. Betts and T. Kumpitsch, we could prove a precise relation between
the Section Conjecture and the Chabauty–Kim method which brings the conjecture closer
to the realm of explicit calculations.

### Recent and current research

  * In joint work with Marius Leonhardt I developed a Chabauty–Coleman method for
    determining and bounding the number of S-integral points on affine curves using the generalised Jacobian. 
    This method is applicable whenever a certain inequality involving the Mordell–Weil rank,
    the genus, the number of cusps, and the size of S is satisfied. This is the analogue
    of the rank-genus inequality in the classical Chabauty method. Our results will be 
    published in two parts, the first one ("Affine Chabauty I") is 
    [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15949){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

  * When applying the Chabauty–Kim method to study S-integral points on _affine_
    hyperbolic curves, a refined version of the method due to A. Betts and N. Dogra
    often gives stronger results. The first explicit calculations using this method
    were carried out by our project group at the 2020 Arizona Winter School.
    We could solve the _S_-unit equation in cases where _S_ contains two primes
    (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10145.pdf) for the paper and
    [here](https://github.com/martinluedtke/dcw_coefficients){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
    for the Sage code). These calculations in depth 2 were insufficient to
    verify Kim's conjecture for _S = {2,3}_ for any choice of auxiliary prime _p_.
    More recently, I derived new Kim functions for the Chabauty–Kim locus in depth 4
    and used them to verify Kim's conjecture for _S = {2,3}_ for all _p < 10,000_.
    The paper is [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40993-024-00597-4) and the
    accompanying Sage code is
    [here](https://github.com/martinluedtke/RefinedCK){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

  * With D. Corwin and I. Dan-Cohen, we are developing and applying the mixed Tate motivic
    Chabauty–Kim method for the thrice-punctured line beyond the polylogarithmic quotient
    of the fundamental group. We obtain new constraints on Chabauty–Kim loci
    by using functions involving p-adic _multiple_ polylogarithms (rather than just single
    polylogarithms).

  * Kim's conjecture predicts that the set of p-adic points produced by the Chabauty–Kim method
    agrees precisely with the set of S-integral points of the curve. With A. Betts and T. Kumpitsch
    we showed that one can prove the "locally geometric" version of Grothendieck's Section Conjecture
    by verifying Kim's conjecture for almost all choices of p. We successfully
    carried this out for **Z**[1/2]-integral points on the thrice-punctured line, thereby
    obtaining the first nontrivial example of a curve where Kim's conjecture is proved for infinitely
    many choices of p. The preprint is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09462.pdf).
  
  * With Xiang Li, I am extending the Chabauty–Kim method for the thrice-punctured line to number fields,
    in particular cyclotomic fields. We can show that Kim's Conjecture holds for **Z**[ζ₃]-points but
    the polylogarithmic quotient is insufficient to prove Kim's Conjecture for integral points over imaginary
    quadratic fields different from **Q**(ζ₃).

  * The p-adic section conjecture for a smooth projective curve X over a
    finite extension K of _**Q**<sub>p</sub>_ predicts that every section of the
    fundamental exact sequence is induced by a K-rational point. Previously, only
    the birational variant, where X is replaced by its generic point, was known.
    In my dissertation I extended this result to larger localisations of X.
    The dissertation is
    [here](https://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/57431/thesis.pdf).
