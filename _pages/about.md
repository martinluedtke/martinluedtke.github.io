I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Steffen Müller at the University of Groningen, Netherlands.

### Research interests

I am interested in arithmetic geometry, specifically the use of
fundamental groups to study rational and integral points of schemes.
The Chabauty–Kim method, while rooted in deep considerations about the motivic fundamental group
and still being largely conjectural, has nevertheless proved very successful
in explicitly solving polynomial equations in recent years. I am exploring both the theoretical
and practical aspects of the method, in particular in the setting of S-integral points on
affine hyperbolic curves. What I find exciting about this line of research is that deep ideas
from geometry can be used to solve very concrete problems from number theory.

I am moreover interested in Grothendieck's conjectures
on anabelian geometry which he formulated in his letter to Faltings. There, the Section Conjecture
predicts a description of rational points purely in terms of étale fundamental groups.
Recently, with A. Betts and T. Kumpitsch, we could prove a precise relation between
the Section Conjecture and the Chabauty–Kim method which brings the conjecture closer
to the realm of explicit calculations.

### Recent research

  * With D. Corwin and I. Dan-Cohen, we are developing and applying the mixed Tate motivic
    Chabauty–Kim method for the thrice-punctured line beyond the polylogarithmic quotient
    of the fundamental group. We obtain new constraints on Chabauty–Kim loci
    by using functions involving p-adic _multiple_ polylogarithms (rather than just single
    polylogarithms). The preprint will be available soon.

  * Kim's conjecture predicts that the set of p-adic points produced by the Chabauty–Kim method
    agrees precisely with the set of S-integral points of the curve. With A. Betts and T. Kumpitsch
    we showed that one can prove the "locally geometric" version of Grothendieck's Section Conjecture
    by verifying Kim's conjecture for almost all choices of p. We successfully
    carried this out for **Z**[1/2]-integral points on the thrice-punctured line, thereby
    obtaining the first example of a curve where Kim's conjecture is proved for infinitely
    many choices of p. The preprint is
    ([here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09462.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}).

  * For a smooth projective hyperbolic curve the classical Chabauty method applies whenever
    the rank-genus inequality _g – r > 0_ holds; the quadratic Chabauty method applies whenever
    _g + ρ – r > 0_ holds. With J. S. Müller and M. Leonhardt we determined the analogous inequalities
    for S-integral points on _affine_ hyperbolic curves. We also obtain bounds on the
    number of S-integral points whenever these inequalities are satisfied.
    The paper is
    ([here](https://doi.org/10.1093/imrn/rnad185){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}).

  * When applying the Chabauty–Kim method to study S-integral points on _affine_
    hyperbolic curves, a refined version of the method due to A. Betts and N. Dogra
    often gives stronger results. With a project group at the 2020 Arizona Winter School
    we carried out the first explicit calculations using this method. We could
    solve the S-unit equation in cases where S contains 2 primes, which had been
    unaccessible with the unrefined Chabauty–Kim method. The paper is
    ([here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10145.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}).
    See also the associated [Sage code](https://github.com/martinluedtke/dcw_coefficients).  
    Recently, I extended these calculations to higher depth and proved Kim's
    conjecture for _S = {2,3}_ and all auxiliary primes _p < 100,000_.
    The Sage code is
    ([here](https://github.com/martinluedtke/RefinedCK){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"})
    and the preprint will be available soon.

  * The p-adic section conjecture for a smooth projective curve X over a
    finite extension K of _**Q**<sub>p</sub>_ predicts that every section of the
    fundamental exact sequence is induced by a K-rational point. Previously, only
    the birational variant, where X is replaced by its generic point, was known.
    In my dissertation I extended this result to larger localisations of X.
    The dissertation is
